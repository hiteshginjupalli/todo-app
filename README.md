Steps to build the app :
1) Create a local directory.
2) Go to the directory and install django using -> pipenv install django (If you don't have pipenv install using brew)
3) To go to the virtual env -> pipenv shell
4) Then create django project using -> django-admin startproject <name of project> .
5) To run server -> run the command -> python manage.py runserver --> This will open a server @127.0.0.1:8000
